Remember, the key building blocks for One-on-One time are Day, Play, and Stay:\n\n**DAY** Try to do it every day\nSpend 5 minutes (or more!) One-on-One time with your child each day.\n\n**PLAY** Let them choose the activity\nTell your child that you would like to spend some time with them and that they can choose what to do or talk about. They might think this is weird at first but will come to enjoy this time with you!\n\n**STAY** Focus on your child \nSwitch off TV and put aside phones. Look at your child or teen. Nod or say “I see” to show you are really paying attention. Accept what they say without judging them.\n\nThe goal is for parents to spend at least 5 minutes of one-on-one time with their child each day.",

      "introduction": "The primary objectives for this week are parents learning and practicing how to talk about their own and their children’s feelings. \n\nThe key building blocks for Talking about Emotions are Breathe, Share, Listen, Show, and Seek:\n\nBREATHE. Slowly. Pause. \nBefore you say anything, slowly breathe in and out. It will calm you and give you a chance to think.\n\nSHARE how you feel\nThis is hard. Many of us were told not to cry or show our feelings to our children. But take a deep breath and calmly tell them how you feel. They will understand better, and also learn from you how to deal with stress. \n\nLISTEN to your child.\nAllow your child to share their emotions. You can also reflect back what you them say to you. Accept that the feeling is okay, even if it is negative.\n\nSHOW them you care\nThis is also hard! Stress makes us focus on ourselves. But our children and teens need our support. Ask them how they feel. Listen to them and comfort them. Try a hug or say, ‘I understand.’ It can change everything.\n\nSEEK the positive\nCan you and your child think about ideas that might help? Can you do something positive together to take your mind off the stress?",

      "faq_title": "Key Issues to Be Aware Of",
      "question_1": "Talking about emotions can be new",
      "response_1": "It is completely normal for parents to have difficulty talking about and expressing emotions and feelings. Parents may be trying to recognise their own emotions and communicate about them for the first time here. Talking about feelings also has the benefit of bringing awareness to positive emotions such as happiness or calmness!",
      "question_2": "Emotions and gender",
      "response_2": "Many people are taught not to cry when they are sad. This might be especially true for boys and men. It’s important to understand that boys and men have the same feelings as girls and women, and that sharing emotions does not need to reduce their sense of masculinity. Sharing emotions is a sign of courage and strength.",
      "question_3": "Accepting negative emotions",
      "response_3": "Negative emotions are just as normal as positive emotions! Some parents might feel disrespected when their children display negative emotions. This does not mean that parents are losing control or authority over their child. Parents should encourage children to be aware of their emotions by helping them to name emotions, and to talk about how they are experiencing their emotions as this will help them to regulate their emotions.",
